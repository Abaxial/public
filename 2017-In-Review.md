# 2017 In Review

# How I moved myself instead of the mountain.

The last days of 2016 found my family and I amidst a pile of packed boxes, across two apartments in the city,
loading up a moving truck and hurtling along highway 410 towards our new home in the Bruce Peninsula. A 27 foot
truck, overkill maybe, and an aim to park it at my mother-in-law's home for a few days before our date of
possession on January 3rd.  In many ways, 2017 didn't really start for us until January 3rd, and in many ways
it started on December 29th as we were Wiarton bound.

## Priorities in 2017

* Establish a comfort and aptitude for remote software development work.
* Bring order to chaos after our move, get out of our temporary moving debt.
* Embrace the community of Wiarton and start to spread roots in the area.

Work was a priority, as was settling up in Wiarton.  On both fronts, great strides were achieved.  Work has become comfortable from a distance or in the office.  I have been able to maintain capability in a remote setting, and continue to grow my abilities towards the more organizational and tech-leadery.  

Community presence was another focus, and settling in to Wiarton.  We've got a tenant for our extra building on our property, and we've settled in just fine.  I'm a member of the local community choir, the cross country ski club, and we've hosted our annual Friendsgiving from our new home and it was a success.

Through all of that, we've continued to raise a curious explorer of a boy as he took his first steps in this home.  He's now learning to form full sentences and continues to grow in leaps and bounds daily when it comes to communication and confidence.

I entered and was one of 3 winners of a poetry contest.  Was compared to Frost by a judge, which was a rather flattering comparison.

Ana and I just celebrated our first Near Year in our new home.  Quiet, and wonderful.  And we look forward to the year ahead.
