Good Day

Decided to pick up 75 strawberry plants this year, will get no fruit this year.  You get the plant, you prune the flowers each week all summer, then they grow next year.

TODO: I guess I'll need to look into how to take care of strawberry plants through the winter.  Do I need to do anything? 

My tomato plants have made it, with some casualties along the way, but we'll have a lot to plant this year. 

My ground cherries have started to pop up through the soil on my starter tray.  Finally germinated and growing.  I hadn't realized it takes upwards of 2 - 6 weeks to germinate those things.  They're such tiny seeds!

Teaching Ash to use a separate bed has been ongoing. Tonight is the fourth night sleeping apart.  It's been hard on him, and only now is it starting to be hard on me.  The amount of strength with which I love my children startles me sometimes.  The visceral feeling of it in my chest startles me sometimes.  I don't know what I wouldn't do for them.
