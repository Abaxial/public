## Guiding Principle
* Is it Healthy?

## General Thoughts
I'm hoping to introduce challenges this year for each month, and stick to them for thirty days at least, with the option to just continue.  To build better habits, and get into a rhythm.  So far I've found it very easy to stick to a routine and 'daily tasks' when I'm not in a stress state, but when work ramps up I find it more and more difficult to maintain.  

Perhaps a way of overcoming that is to attack the points of stress in an intellectual way when they arise.  In a way, my first challenge month should set a decent foundation of calm and focus to help with that endeavour.
