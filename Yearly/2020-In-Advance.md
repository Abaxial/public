# 2020 - Deep Focus

## Guiding Principle

* Deep Focus

## General Thoughts

I'm hoping to bring myself back to the ability to practice deep focus and thought in my daily life.  

I want to disarm the little receptors in my brain that constantly want to push content to the web for approval right when and where I have a thought without first building up some content just for myself.  Without going through a process of deep focus and intense thought.

As I sit here on the threshold of the new year I'm excited at the prospect of some of the changes I'd love to make.  What I write below, here, is just my in-advance thoughts on what I'd like to accomplish.

## Specific Goals

* At least a one a month update of some kind.
* Have written 100000 words by the end of the year.
* Continue Intermittent Fasting with a goal of trying to lose about 1lb a week, but will only start caring about counting calories after march.  Until then, will let just normal Intermittent Fasting do it's thing.
* Have read at least 10 books in the year
  * Have put thoughts to paper on each of the books I've read.
