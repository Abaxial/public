# 2018

## Guiding Principle
* Don't dilly dally.

### Success
* It hasn't been a perfect year in adherence to this guiding principle, but I
feel that the spirit of the principle has been applied through the year.  I've
felt more forward momentum on various goals, and I've let things sit for less time
before tackling them, when they've been on my radar.

* I don't have any metrics of this, but have recently begun using a bullet journal
system that should allow me to better track dalliances in the future.  Despite
a new guiding principle likely for next year.

## Specific Goals
* Play guitar each day at least long enough to play one song through
* Learn at least 1 new guitar song by the end of each month.
* Exercise Daily
* Read at least 1 book in a month, selected from lists of most impactful books of those I admire and respect.

### Failure
* Pretty much a failure on all specific goal fronts in 2018.

## General Goals
* Increase guitar ability
* Increase body self esteem
* Read more

### Failure
* Pretty much a failure on all fronts.

## Hopes

* I hope to spend more time preparing the garden indoors with pre-planting and germination inside.
* I hope to continue going to Toronto every month and a half roughly to be present among my co-workers.

### Mixed
* I did not pre-plant anything in 2018.
* I did make it to Toronto regularly.

## What went well?
* We had our second child this year.  Io Nelleke Ratcliffe Fera.  Healthy, happy, and thriving at 9 months.
* I was thriving in my role as Scrum Master on my project at work.  Am now taking shared responsibility for architecture of the project as it moves forward in 2019.
* Kept up with some really fit people on a 10k hike.
* Grew a pumpkin!
* Started using a bullet journal.
* Butternut squashes.
* We did walk quite a lot during the warmer seasons.
* Collected our first batch of honey this year.

## What didn't go well?
* None of the specific goals I set were achieved, really.  
* I Didn't get around to regularly weeding the garden.
* Didn't get to building anything with wood.

## 5 Year Retrospective

When I look back on the last 5 years I feel pretty accomplished.  5 years ago I set out to switch careers, position myself to work remotely, and begin working remotely.  I've achieved those goals, and in the same span also got married, had two children, and bought a property on the Bruce Peninsula.  I really need to think about what the next 5 years look like.  And the next 10. And the next 20.
