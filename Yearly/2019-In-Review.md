## Guiding Principle

* Is it Healthy?

## General Thoughts

2019 is ending in about an hour and a half.

The year was a success in many ways, and still did not take the shape as intended in the beginning.  Almost none of the goals I put to paper ended in a hard success at the end of this year, and yet I consider the year a success overall.

I *did* try and adhere to the 'is it healthy' guiding principle, and rounded out the year with essentially 3 solid months of intermittent fasting in the form of an average of 18/6.  That's 6 hours in which I eat every day and 18 hours in which I might have a coffee and a bunch of water.

Intermittent fasting in this way is not sloughing off the pounds, but there is slow and steady decline in my weight, and a retention of my overall mental acuity through this process.

I've lost about 15 lbs since starting.

The most remarkable thing that has me optimistic heading into January, is that it was a routine I was able to keep such that I maintained at least a 16/8 (16 hour fast and maximum 8 hour window for eating) since beginning.

Beyond that, I started supplementing with Magnesium and it's had a large effect on my sleep cycle through the night.  When I do wake up, it's as I used to remember it being such that I basically turn over and go back to sleep.  Given the insomnia I've dealt with in the past, it's been wonderfully effective.

I'm disappointed most in not having read 12 books.

I found out a friend of mine died this year and it shook me.  I connected some with some friends of mine as a direct ripple, and reconnected with my writing as well as an outcome, though not as tenaciously as I wanted.

Work burnt me out this year.  I overworked myself in an effort to help the client through some rough times, and while the client appreciated the effort, I overextended myself and am only now starting to surface from it after 10 days off.  I don't like that I did that to myself, when I get into a state like that my other things in life begin to fall by the wayside, and in this case some side goals of mine to write were impacted.

I became officially a Senior Software Developer this year at my company, but I very much feel a constant battle in myself against imposter syndrome.  I do have, and certainly have the perspective that I willalways have, something to learn.

In this past year I've developed a thirst for finding out what's next for me and my family now that we've been here for 3 years remotely.
