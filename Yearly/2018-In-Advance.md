# 2018

## Guiding Principle
* Don't dilly dally.

## Specific Goals
* Play guitar each day at least long enough to play one song through
* Learn at least 1 new guitar song by the end of each month.
* Exercise Daily
* Read at least 1 book in a month, selected from lists of most impactful books of those I admire and respect.

## General Goals
These are kind of goal themes that can be expanded upon with specific goal ties.

* Increase guitar ability
* Increase body self esteem
* Read more

## Hopes

* I hope to spend more time preparing the garden indoors with pre-planting and germination inside.
* I hope to continue going to Toronto every month and a half roughly to be present among my co-workers.


## The Path Ahead, what I know

We're expecting our second born in April of this coming year, it's going to start off as a challenge.  We'll get through it as with the first, but it will likely be tough in the beginning.  With a 2 year old in the saddle and far more mobile, but also stubborn and learning to communicate more effectively, he'll be putting a lot of that newfound knowledge into saying 'no' in more and more creative ways.

I know we'll have to have patience and guide him appropriately as we welcome his little sibling into the world.  It'll be a change for him as much as it will be for myself and Ana.

I know we plan to be at summerfolk again this year, though it will be a little more difficult with a super wee one tagging along.

We're planning on giving chickens another go this year.  We'll likely be raising them from chicks.  The coop is mostly ready, just a few patches to go with some wire around the roof to weasel proof it.  Stack some more rocks aorund the base.

Fortunately, the same rocks in our soil that make gardening new ground difficult make it hard to dig under the walls of the coop for predators.

These are some things I know, but much more remains to be seen.  What will 2018 bring to us?  I don't know.  But you'll find me dilly dallying less as we march forward through it.
