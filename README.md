This is who I am. A work in progress.
There's this guy, Buster Benson, who has a thing called [Book of Beliefs](https://buster.gitbooks.io/public/book-of-beliefs.html) and I liked the idea a great deal.
This is my own place to have an accountable self. To continuously reflect and outline how I see and interact with the world.
